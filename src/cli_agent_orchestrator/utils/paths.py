"""Working-directory normalization for operator-supplied paths.

The dashboard runs in the user's browser — on WSL setups that browser is on
WINDOWS, so users naturally paste Windows paths (``C:\\Users\\me\\project``,
often quoted by Explorer's "Copy as path"). cao-server runs inside WSL where
those paths only exist under the ``/mnt/<drive>/`` interop mount. Observed
live: every run-wizard launch with a Windows path failed as an opaque 500.

    - Strips quotes (Windows Explorer's "Copy as path" wraps in ``"``).
    - Expands ``~``.
    - Translates Windows paths (``C:\\x\\y`` or ``C:/x/y``) to the WSL interop
      mount (``/mnt/c/x/y``) when that drive mount exists.
    - Auto-creates the directory when missing (the run wizard points at where
      the user WANTS the project; erroring on a not-yet-existing folder would
      just bounce them to a terminal — the thing the UI exists to avoid).
